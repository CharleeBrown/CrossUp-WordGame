# Oh yeah, btw

## I had this idea 
for a wordle clone of sorts.
Well, it is and it isn't a clone.
My idea is to take the aspect of a crossword and merge it with the wordle idea.

Rules are : you get one guess, but you do get a hint.
I'm struggling with two main things at the moment.

- I'm not sure how i want to style the inputs
- I'm not sure If it should be one try and three
:	One try may make the user more annoyed.
:	Three tries may be too many.
